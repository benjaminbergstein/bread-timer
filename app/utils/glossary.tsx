### Autolyse


A technique for **building up dough strength** early in the breadmaking process
by mixing some or all of the flour and water before adding the levain. As soon
as flour and water make contact, gluten development begins. Autolyse allows this
gluten development to start before adding the levain.

Once the levain is mixed with the other ingredients, the dough enters a finite
fermentation period before maximum leavening power. This period is a function
of dough & air temperature, innoculation percentage and food (flour).


### Baker's Percentages


A **form of measurement** used in a dough recipe that expresses the amount of an
ingredient as a percentage of the flour in the recipe. So if a recipe includes 100 grams
of an ingredient and 1000 grams of flour, that ingredient has a baker's percentage of 10%.


### Bulk (Ferment)

The period of time during which the dough undergoes **bacterial cultivation (fermentation)**
occurs *before* it is divided into individual loaves.


### Fold

A technique for developing dough strength in which the dough is stretched and folded
over itself. "Stretch and fold" is one of a number of ways to **gently agitate high-hydration
dough** instead of kneading (which may not be possible when dough is quite wet).

Other techniques include coil folds, "slap and fold", Rubaud method, and lamination.


### Levain


Levain is a **natural leavening agent**, most widely known for its use in
sourdough bread making. A levain is build up from a smaller amount starter
(sometimes "mother"), to an amount that can successfully leaven bread.


### Hydration (Percent)


The **amount of water** in a dough expressed in baker's percentages. A dough prepared with
700 grams of water and 1000 grams of flour has a hydration percentage of 70%, and
would be considered somewhat wet. Doughs in the 60% range are considered dry, while
80% is quite wet. Hydration should be calculated including the amounts of water and flour
in the starter as well.


### Innoculation (Percent)


The **amount of bacterial starter** in a dough express in baker's percentages. A dough prepared
with 200 grams of starter and 1000 grams of flour has a innoculation percentage of 20%.
